 The article explains the historical and mathematical development of the concept of infinity, from ancient philosophy to the modern
 <br>theory of sets. Early Greek ideas, such as Anaximander's apeiron and the Pythagoreans' unease with the infinite, are contrasted
 <br>with Zeno's paradoxes and Aristotle's distinction between potential and actual infinity. The study also discusses theological
 <br>interpretations of infinity with regard to divine nature, the Renaissance shifts to infinity in the universe, and Galileo's insights
 <br>into infinite sets. Calculus itself introduced practical infinite processes. It was not until Georg Cantor developed his revolutionary
 <br>set theory that infinities of different sizes could be identified. The paper concludes by highlighting the ongoing significance of
 <br>infinity in contemporary mathematics, physics, and philosophy, presenting it as a concept that continually expands human understanding
 <br>of the limitless.

 <p id="Introduction_InText">
 
 Infinity represents one of the most intriguing, if not puzzling, conceptions humankind has ever developed. It has been said
 <br>to sit at the juncture between mathematics, philosophy, and theology, and that it often inspires a sense of wonder, occasionally
 <br>one of deep unease. From its earliest appearances in ancient civilizations to its rigorous formulation in modern set theory,
 <br>the history of infinity traces humanity's evolution in understanding the limitless. In mathematics, infinity represents unbounded
 <br>quantities, found in limits, infinite series, and the size of sets. It is not a number but a concept that describes endlessness.
 <br>There exist infinities of different sizes and there are countable and uncountable sets, which reshaped modern analysis and set theory.

 <p id="Analysis_InText">
 
   The concept of infinity can be traced to ancient civilisations, particularly in Greek philosophy. Someone called Anaximander 
   <br>proposed the idea of the apeiron, which means “the boundless”. Anaximander said that the apeiron was the origin of all things,
   <br>an eternal and unlimited substance from which the cosmos was created. This was one of humanity’s first  attempts in recorded
   <br>history at trying to understand the concept of infinity. 
   <br>
   <br>Later, Pythagoreans saw the world as a harmonious structure where everything was controlled by numbers, but infinity troubled
   <br>them. They believed the cosmos was finite and ordered, and anything infinite seemed chaotic or irrational to them. The discovery
   <br>that the square root of two was irrational was a crisis for their view, as it suggested something endless and non-repeating 
   <br>in mathematics. 
   <br>
   <br>But it was Zeno of Elea who made infinity a central philosophical problem. Zeno's paradoxes, such as Achilles and the 
   <br>tortoise or the dichotomy paradox, highlighted some troubling issues about infinite divisibility. How can motion take place if
   <br>reaching any point requires crossing infinitely many smaller intervals? Zeno's puzzles forced later thinkers to consider
   <br>whether infinite processes could be completed and whether space and time were composed of indivisible numbers or infinitely
   <br>divisible numbers.
   <br>
   <br>The philosopher Aristotle later distinguished between potential infinity and actual infinity. Potential infinity referred 
   <br>to processes that could go on without end, such as adding 1 repeatedly to obtain larger and larger numbers. Actual infinity
   <br>was the completed existence of an infinite quantity. Aristotle rejected actual infinity as paradoxical and insisted that only
   <br>potential infinity was logically acceptable. 
   <br>
   <br>During the Middle Ages, a link between infinity and the divine nature of God was made by philosophers of Christian,
   <br>Islamic, and Jewish religion. People such as St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas argued that God was infinite in power and
   <br>perfection. Although they agreed with Aristotle's view that actual infinity could not exist in the physicaluniverse, they
   <br>believed only God's being was truly infinite.
   <br>
   <br>The Renaissance renewed mathematical and philosophical investigation. Giordano Bruno famously suggested that the universe
   <br>was infinite, containing an innumerable quantity of stars and worlds. Though highly controversial and eventually fatal to Bruno,
   <br>this idea did represent a major turning point: the infinite was no longer restricted to God but could be used to describe the 
   <br>physical universe itself. 
   <br>
   <br>Galileo Galilei made fundamental contributions to mathematics. He remarked on a surprising property: the natural numbers can be
   <br>put into one-to-one correspondence with their squares, despite the fact that most numbers are not perfect squares. This meant a whole 
   <br>infinite set could be no larger than one of its proper subsets - an impossible property for finite sets. Galileo concluded that the 
   <br>ordinary notions of size or comparison did not apply to infinite magnitudes.
   <br>
   <br>In 1655, John Wallis introduced the symbol for infinity. Independently of each other, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz 
   <br>developed the basics of calculus during this time using infinite processes to study motion and change. The modern understanding of 
   <br>infinity changed a lot in the late 19th century with the work of Georg Cantor. Cantor introduced the concept of set theory and 
   <br>showed that there are different sizes of infinity. He showed, for example, that although the set of natural numbers is infinite,
   <br>the set of real numbers represents a larger infinity. This he called uncountable. This refuted the long-held belief that infinity
   <br>was single and indivisible.
   <br>
   <br>Cantor also introduced the concept of transfinite numbers. These are numbers representing the different magnitudes of infinity and
   <br>developed the notation for the smallest infinite number of items in a set. His revolutionary ideas had much resistance from some, 
   <br>including the mathematician Leopold Kronecker, who rejected actual infinity on philosophical grounds. However, eventually, Cantor's 
   <br>work became foundational to modern mathematics.
   <br>
   <br>Infinity also plays an important role in topology, measure theory, cosmology, and computer science. Today physics struggles with 
   <br>infinities in theories about space and time.
   <br>
   <br>History of Infinity is about the expansion of intellectual horizons. It was first forbidden, then divine, then paradoxical and finally
   <br>positive in its consequences for mathematics. But infinity remains a symbol of humanity trying to understand the boundless - even if our
   <br>grasp always extends just beyond reach. There are many different symbols related to infinity. These can be shown with their meanings,
   <br>significance and origins below.
